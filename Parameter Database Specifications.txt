Parameter Database Specifications{
	Table storage location{
		Each of the following tables will likely need to be present both within the device and on our servers.
		Save location within device. SD info sectors could be dedicated if EEPROM doesn't have enough room.
		Device and server will sync if a "change of settings" flag has been set from either device or on server.
		To keep syncing straight, any setting changes may need an additional table recording the change date.
	}
	Device-Server communication method:{ //This belongs somewhere else in the specification documentation.
		TBD, but standard TCP/IP transfer is within the capability of our processor and wifi module, using existing standards. We would like to minimize the need for extra drivers.
	}

	Tables that will be have unique values that should not be mirrored between SERVER and DEVICE{
		Server Specific Parameters:{
			update_flag		BOOLEAN	//quick reference for if parameter sync is needed due to updates since last sync.
		}
		Device Specific Parameters:{
			update_flag		BOOLEAN	//quick reference for if parameter sync is needed due to updates since last sync.
		}
	}

Additional features to consider after above is working:{

Energy and Power transition values.{
	We may develop an algorithmically driven adjustment curve to help increase the information value of the color changes.

Disaggregation and Classification{	

	Appliance Identification Table{
		This could be very useful once disaggregation is implemented. This data should be mirrored in the Cloud and on SD storage.
		Unique_POWERSIGNATURE_ID 		INTEGER(10-bit should be enough) // we'll need to balance how many signatures we'll want to keep track of with how many SD sectors we want to designate for this table.
		Assignable_Appliance_Name 		STRING(ID# used until Name assigned)	
		Manually Identified or Statistically assigned Name		BOOLEAN
		Signature_Vector_Space			MATRIX //statistically acceptible indenfication space for for new signatures to be compared against.
		Quality_Rating_of_V-Space		INTEGER (4-bit) //Improves over time as SERVER gians more confidence for each appliance. Helps determine boundary for whether a detected power change is assigned a new ID or not.	Also, will be used to recycle Signature_ID values if we run out of space in the predetermined table size. If we run out of room, higher confidence ratings will replace the lowest confidence ratings.

	Signature Event Table{
		Timestamp (ID)				TIMESTAMP
		Unique_POWERSIGNATURE_ID 	INTEGER
